# **Executive summary**

(Maximum of 4 sentences)

Studying the relationship between life expectancy and the Gini coefficient is essentially exploring the connection between economic inequality and health inequality.

In this era that emphasizes economic development, people's physical health should be equally prioritized.

By comparing the Gini coefficients and life expectancies across different economies and regions, we can gain a more intuitive and comprehensive understanding of a particular economy or region's development level.

Furthermore, researching the relationship between these inequalities can provide new directions for economic development goals.
